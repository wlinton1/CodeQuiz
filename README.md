# CodeQuiz

# IMPORTANT, my brother and I got into a fight and he deleted my homework repositories. I wanted to let the graders know since the initial commit is going to have everything and will look like the assignment is late. If you need more info on why it happened etc. email me I plan to let my instructor know tomorrow as well

In this assignment we were meant to creat a quiz application that tester our knowledge of coding information. I was able to figure everything out. It took me longest to figure out how to make some things hidden on the page which I used W3schools tutorials for. I also watched a couple youtube videos to get a better handle on the code I was writing . My highscores save to local storage and you can clear them as well. I set the timer to 60 seconds and if you missed a question you are deducted 5 seconds off said timer. It was a lot more javascript code to write than I thought and I did it in the order I figured things out so it was a bit of a hastle overall.
