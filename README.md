# CodeQuiz

# wettimlinton123@gmail.com

In this assignment we were meant to creat a quiz application that tester our knowledge of coding information. I was able to figure everything out. It took me longest to figure out how to make some things hidden on the page which I used W3schools tutorials for. I also watched a couple youtube videos to get a better handle on the code I was writing . My highscores save to local storage and you can clear them as well. I set the timer to 60 seconds and if you missed a question you are deducted 5 seconds off said timer. It was a lot more javascript code to write than I thought and I did it in the order I figured things out so it was a bit of a hastle overall.
